# Code of Conduct

The FerroTunnel project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/). This describes the minimum behavior expected from all contributors.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project team at **shahmitul005@gmail.com** (or by opening a confidential issue).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Moderation

To avoid confusion with the Rust project’s own moderation, we state our policy explicitly. Reports are handled by the FerroTunnel maintainers. We may respond with a warning, temporarily restrict participation (e.g. on GitHub), or permanently exclude someone, depending on severity and history. If you disagree with a moderation decision, please contact us **in private** (e.g. by email); we ask that complaints about moderation not be pursued in public issue threads or PRs.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/) and the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0.
